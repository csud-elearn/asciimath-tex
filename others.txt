My own goals: Something lightweight, simple and immediately practical for
mathematicians.

nath
- replacement for left/right (spacing, better choice)
- decide whether to use / based on display/inline
(use frac(x)(y) to force fractions as display, and x//y as inline.
- Also their subfractions don't get smaller; that's nice.

nath really hasn't caught on, despite its coolness.  Most likely because it's
not compatible with amsmath.  I think if I don't try to implement the equation
environments it'll fix many incompatibilities.

breqn: Not quite what I'm trying to do, but it's the same basic philosophy as
asciimath and nath.

ASCIIMathML: my motivation.  Should keep porting features from it.

Other things to check out:
"MathML Formatting with TeX rules"
"Two linear formats interoperable with MathML"
"Unicode nearly-plain-text encoding of mathematics"
